        <p>I present to you: my own course to learn the bare basics of <b>HTMl, CSS & JavaScript!</b></p>

        <h3>What is HTML?</h3>
        <p>HTML is the coding language used for building the basics for your website or application. By using
            <b>tags</b> you can add text, titles, images, links, checkboxes, dropdowns, and buttons with HTML tags
            alone.
        </p>
        <p>When writing HTML I strongly advise to use <b>semantic tags</b>. These are tags that say something about the
            content inside of them. for example: a <b>nav</b> tag is used to make a navigation bar. Not only is using
            semantic tags useful to keep your code clean and organised for yourself, its also very good for google's
            indexing system. Semantic tags also make your website or application easy to read for screenreaders. On the
            topic of screenreaders, when you put an image somewhere make sure to add <b>alt="description of this
                image"</b> with the contents of the picture written in it to make sure it's screen reader friendly!</p>

            <div>
                <div><b>h</b></div>
                <p>Used to make titles. h1 is for your most important title, h6 for the least important ones. Usually I
                    never go past using h3. I reccommend having only one h1, you can have multiple of the rest.</p>
